# py4ctrl -- python for control of power electronics.

Currently Basic buck, boost, and buckâ€“boost converters with current programmed control are summarized, as well as Control-to-output and line-to-output transfer functions for more accurate model.

Resonant Converters design analysis, take LLC as example, simulated voltage gain function, Load-Dependent Properties of Resonant Converters and tank transfer function. 

Also included theory of automatic control system coded in python, such as Fourier Series and Fourier Transform, basic types of compensators / filters, relationship between s-domain and z-domain.

Recommend to run this project under mamba enviroment, with spyder installed:

1. Mambaforge can be got from:

    https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge
    
2. After install, run below commands:

	mamba install control
	
	mamba install numpy
	
	mamba install matplotlib
	
	mamba install scipy
	
	mamba install sympy
	
	mamba install slycot
	
	mamba install spyder
	
	mamba install jupyterlab
	


Target of this project is to help understanding theory of power electronics, including: Modeling, Simulation and so on.
